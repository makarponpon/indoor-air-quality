## Introduction

Indoor air quality (IAQ) plays a significant role in the health and comfort of individuals. Poor air quality can lead to various health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and even long-term diseases. This repository aims to provide tools and methodologies to assess vulnerabilities related to indoor air quality in different neighborhoods.

By leveraging spatial data science and cluster analysis, we can identify areas that may require intervention or improvement. This project combines demographic data, housing indices, and environmental factors to create a comprehensive assessment tool.

## Project Goals

1. **Classify Indoor Air Quality Vulnerabilities**: Develop a classification system that identifies neighborhoods at risk of poor indoor air quality.
2. **Analyze Demographic Factors**: Investigate how demographics affect indoor air quality.
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Utilize spatial data science techniques to visualize and analyze indoor air quality data.
4. **Raise Awareness**: Provide insights that can help policymakers and community leaders make informed decisions regarding air quality.

## Topics Covered

This project encompasses a variety of topics, including:

- **Ambience**: The overall atmosphere and environment within indoor spaces.
- **Ambient Vulnerability**: Understanding how environmental factors contribute to indoor air quality issues.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping neighborhoods based on similar indoor air quality characteristics.
- **Demographics**: Studying the population characteristics that affect air quality.
- **Exposure**: Evaluating the levels of exposure to indoor pollutants.
- **Housing**: Analyzing the relationship between housing quality and air quality.
- **Indices**: Developing indices to quantify indoor air quality.
- **Indoor**: Focusing specifically on air quality within indoor environments.
- **Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)**: Using LSOA data for localized analysis.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Employing spatial techniques to visualize and interpret data.
- **Spatial Data Science**: Applying data science methods to spatial datasets.
- **Vulnerability**: Identifying vulnerable populations and areas.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from various reliable sources, including:

- **Government databases**: National and local statistics on air quality, housing, and demographics.
- **Environmental agencies**: Reports and datasets on indoor air pollutants.
- **Community surveys**: Data collected from residents regarding their indoor environments.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/makarponpon/indoor-air-quality.git
   cd indoor-air-quality
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
